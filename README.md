# React Implementation of EIP-712 Wrapper for EIP-1271

This project is a React implementation of the EIP-712 wrapper for EIP-1271, designed to protect EIP-1271 wallets against replay attacks while allowing full auditability of the signed message contents. The original logic and design are based on the repository available at [frangio/eip712-wrapper-for-eip1271](https://github.com/frangio/eip712-wrapper-for-eip1271/).
